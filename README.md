# 2d-Strip-Packing-Problem

This repository contains the implementations of the two-dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2SP) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_packing_problem). The [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language is used!

The 2SP consists in packing all the items in a strip of width ùëä and infinite height. Each item has it own width and height. The objective is to minimize the total height used to pack the items without overlapping and going outside the strip. The orientation of items is fixed, that is, they cannot be rotated.

More details about 2SP formulation, exact algorithms used and implementation are given in [2SP description](https://github.com/radubuzatu/2d-Strip-Packing/blob/main/2SP%20description.pdf).
