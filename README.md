# 2d-Strip-Packing-Problem

This repository contains the implementations of the 2d Strip Packing Problem (2SP) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem). The [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language is used!

The 2SP optimizes the placing of rolls within the trucks so that the specific load is maximum and all rolls are distributed among the trucks. 
Here, the specific load is the ratio of the total weight of all rolls to the maximum allowable load of all used trucks.

More details about TPP formulation and the exact approach for solving TPP are given in [Truck Packing description](https://github.com/radubuzatu/Truck-Packing-Bin-Packing/blob/main/Truck%20Packing%20description.pdf).
